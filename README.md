# Mathematics - 105torus Project
Language: Python

Drawing circles, cylinders and cones is a good start for an image synthesis software, but one have to admit it is not fully satisfying. . . This project is the continuation of the previous one, and should allow you to draw more complex forms, such as a torus, which do not emerge from 2nd degree equations, but from superior degree equations (4th degree in the torus case).
The objective of this project is to solve a 4th degree equation:

A direct resolution method does exist (Ferrari’s method), but does not generalize to higher degrees. Thus, we will rather compare 3 iterative algorithms:
  - The bisection method.
  - Newton’s method.
  - The secant method.
